# Getting started üöÄ

If you are interested in my project and want to run it locally, there is nothing easier. Here is the complete guide:

## Setup üîß

All you need to run the project locally is the following:

- Installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 18.x or higher (with npm package manager).
- Installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- Any code editor such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) or any other of your choice.

## Running üèÉ

If all the things in the list above are installed, you can clone our repository using the following command:
